# Traffic Segues

This project contains the source code for the TrafficSegues project in Unit 3.6 of App Development with Swift. There are two branches:

* The initial branch that creates segues with Interface Builder
* The branch that uses code to select which segue to show.

The master branch contains the final completed code for the programmatic segues.
